<h1 align=center> My Replicube </h1>

Yesterday, I was scrolling on instagram reals, and I saw lua, so of course (I love lua) I had to like ! <br/>
But also, I wanted to make that game, because it seems to be an interessant project to work on, so here it is, 1 day coding.

Shout out & credits to the dude that I just entirely copied (im sorry btw), go like and subscribe to him if you like what he does:

## How to ?
If you dont know how to use golang, do that:
1. Install golang
2. `go build .`
3. `./myreplicube lua/balls.lua`

You can edit the files, and the code will automatically detect when a change occurs
